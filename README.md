# LeveragingLLMforVulnDetection
Final Project Public Repo

Note: No Aveni Datasets could be published in this public repo, due to privacy rights.

# Experiment Code

All experiments carry out binary vulnerability classificaiton by querying GPT-4 through the OpenAI API. The API key has been removed for publishing here as it is owned by Aveni.
All experiments were carried out in jupyter notebooks using Python.

* Experiment 1 - Zero-shot Learning Baseline
* Experiment 4 - Few-Shot Learning Baseline
* Experiment 5 - Chain of Thought Prompting (Includes the two data sources - and the sampling of each of them and the polairty of examples within them)
* Experiment 6 - OPRO Prompt Optimisaiton framework baseline + testing of APO and APE framework (to test their concepts)
* Experiment 6 EdiPrompt - EdiPrompt Prompt Optimisation Framework (Note: not automated, as small number of iterations, wanted to ensure was working correctly, could easily be automated in future)

# RoBERTa Code
* Training the model
* Testing Hyperparamters on validation set
* Testing the final model
